This is the course webpage for Economics 671 at Iowa State (Fall
2013). It has a few links, and that’s about it.  I haven’t finalized
the 2014 syllabus yet, but I will post it here when it is ready.

Before emailing me or the TA about this class, please read [these
email guidelines](/dl/email).
([written by Michael Leddy][leddy].)

The required textbooks for the class are:

* Greene’s *[Econometric Analysis][]* (2011, 7th edition). This book will be used in Econ 672 as well.
* Casella and Berger’s *Statistical Inference* (2001, second edition).

The following textbooks are recommended for the class:

[Econometrics Analysis]: http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~wgreene/Text/econometricanalysis.htm

* Freedman’s *[Statistical Models: Theory and practice][]* (second edition)
* Gallant’s *[Introduction to Econometric Theory][]*

[Statistical Models: Theory and practice]: http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~census
[Introduction to Econometric Theory]: http://www.aronaldg.org/courses/econ501

I’m also in the process of converting my lecture notes for this class
into a free textbook.  You are certainly welcome to contribute and any
feedback is appreciated. [You can read more about it on the project’s
homepage](http://www.econometricslibrary.com/core).

Additional recommendations

### Books and lectures

These are great. Read them all.

* Cleveland’s *Visualizing Data* (1993)
* Geweke's *Complete and Incomplete Econometric Models* (2010)
* Jaynes's *Probability Theory: The Logic of Science* (2003)

developments and puts video and slides online. A list of the topics is
[available here](http://www.nber.org/SI_econometrics_lectures.html).

### Software

* [Julia Language](http://julialang.org/)
* [R Project for Statistical Computing](http://www.r-project.org)
* [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/) (Scientific python)

### Writing advice

At some point you’ll be expected to write a dissertation. The advice
in these books is pretty good. They’re listed in the order they should
be read.

* Strunk and White’s *[The Elements of Style][]* (4th edition)
* Miller’s *[The Chicago Guide to Writing about Multivariate Analysis][]*
  (second edition)
* Williams and Bizup’s *Style: The Basics of Clarity and Grace*
  (5th edition)

Material from previous years
----------------------------

I’ve changed the order of the material substantially from year to year,
so don’t use past exams as study guides. But the old exams might help
you learn what sort of questions I find interesting.

* 2013 [syllabus](syllabus-2013) and [final exam](test-final-2013.pdf).
* 2012 [syllabus](syllabus-2012),
  [midterm 1](test1-2012.pdf),
  [midterm 2](test2-2012.pdf), and
  [final](test-final-2012.pdf).
* 2011 [syllabus](syllabus-2011.pdf),
  [midterm](test1-2011.pdf), and
  [final](test-final-2011.pdf).
* 2010 [syllabus](syllabus-2010.pdf),
  [midterm](test1-2010.pdf), and
  [final](test-final2010.pdf).
* 2009 [syllabus](syllabus-2009.pdf),
  [midterm](test1-2009.pdf), and
  [final](test-final-2009.pdf).

Feel free to use any of this material if you are teaching a similar
class. I will try to help out with lecture notes, etc., if you
email, <gcalhoun@iastate.edu>
