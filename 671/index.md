Material from previous years
----------------------------

I’ve changed the order of the material substantially from year to year,
so don’t use past exams as study guides. But the old exams might help
you learn what sort of questions I find interesting.

* 2013 [syllabus](syllabus-2013) and [final exam](test-final-2013.pdf).
* 2012 [syllabus](syllabus-2012),
  [midterm 1](test1-2012.pdf),
  [midterm 2](test2-2012.pdf), and
  [final](test-final-2012.pdf).
* 2011 [syllabus](syllabus-2011.pdf),
  [midterm](test1-2011.pdf), and
  [final](test-final-2011.pdf).
* 2010 [syllabus](syllabus-2010.pdf),
  [midterm](test1-2010.pdf), and
  [final](test-final2010.pdf).
* 2009 [syllabus](syllabus-2009.pdf),
  [midterm](test1-2009.pdf), and

Feel free to use any of this material if you are teaching a similar
class. I will try to help out with lecture notes, etc., if you
email me: <gcalhoun@iastate.edu>.
