This is the course webpage for Economics 671 at Iowa State (Fall
2013). It has a few links, and that's about it.  I haven't finalized
the 2014 syllabus yet, but I will post it here when it is ready.

Before emailing me or the TA about this class, please read [these
email guidelines](/dl/email).
([written by Michael Leddy][leddy].)

I'm in the process of converting my lecture notes for this class into
a free textbook.  You are certainly welcome to contribute and any
feedback is appreciated. [You can read more about it
on the project's homepage](http://www.econometricslibrary.com/core).

Material from previous years
----------------------------
* [2013 syllabus](syllabus-2013)
* [2012 syllabus](syllabus-2012)

I've changed the order of the material substantially from year to year,
so don't use past exams as study guides. But the old exams might help
you learn what sort of questions I find interesting.

* 2012 exams will be put online soon.
* 2011 [midterm](econ-671-2011-midterm.pdf) and 
  [final](econ-671-2011-final.pdf)
* 2010 [midterm](econ-671-2010-midterm.pdf) and 
  [final](econ-671-2010-final.pdf)
* 2009 [final](econ-671-2009-final.pdf) (I've misplaced
  the midterm)
