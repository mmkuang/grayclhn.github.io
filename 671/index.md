This is the course webpage for Economics 671 at Iowa State (Fall
2013). It has a few links, and that's about it. I'll add material as
we move through the semester.

* [Course syllabus](/671/2013/syllabus)

* Homework:
    * [Assignment 1](/671/2013/hw1)
    * [Assignment 2](/671/2013/hw2)

* Exams from previous years:
    * 2012 exams will be put online soon.
    * 2011 [midterm](/671/dl/econ-671-2011-midterm.pdf) and 
      [final](/671/dl/econ-671-2011-final.pdf)
    * 2010 [midterm](/671/dl/econ-671-2010-midterm.pdf) and 
      [final](/671/dl/econ-671-2010-final.pdf)
    * 2009 [final](/671/dl/econ-671-2009-final.pdf) (I've misplaced
      the midterm)

I changing the order of the material substantially from year to year,
so don't use past exams as study guides. But the old exams might help
you learn what sort of questions I find interesting.
