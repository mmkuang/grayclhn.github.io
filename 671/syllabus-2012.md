title: Econ 671 Syllabus, Fall 2012
layout: default
---

This class has three goals.  You are going to study and learn some
fundamental techniques in econometrics and statistics so that you can
use them in your future research.  You are also going to learn some of
the basic theoretical concepts in econometrics so that you can
understand new techniques when you encounter them in future classes
and later in your career.  Finally, you're going to learn how to use a
computer to do statistical and econometric analysis.

-------------------

If you have questions about the course material, the best times to
address them are in the scheduled lectures or during office hours.  We
can probably resolve questions or concerns about the course
administration over email, but if you have urgent questions please
call me or stop by my office.

Schedule
--------

The class will meet twice a week for almost two hours.  The next table
lists the most important times and dates.  If you have any conflicts
please let me know as soon as possible.

The weekly review session will be used primarily for discussion of the
homework and practice questions, but will also be used to present new
material that supplements the regular lecture.

Grading
-------

Your final grade will be based on two midterm exams, one take home
final exam, and some homework exercises.  The breakdown is as follows:

<dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dt>Midterm 1</dt>
  <dd>25%</dd>

  <dt>Midterm 2</dt>
  <dd>25%</dd>

  <dt>Final</dt>
  <dd>35%</dd>

  <dt>Homework</dt>
  <dd>15%</dd>
</dl>

Homework is due in the TA's mailbox at 4:45 every Thursday afternoon. 

Software
--------

You need to learn how to program a computer to do statistical and
econometric analysis.  We're going to use the programming language *R*
in this class.  It is a specialized programming language that is
designed for sophisticated data analysis.  It has three advantages
over other statistical packages: it is very extensible, so designing
and using new estimators is easy; the graphics it produces are
excellent; and it is free (other packages have their own advantages as
well, obviously).  Also, I use R in my own research so my advice on
programming is more likely to be useful than if we were to use another
language.  You can download the latest version of R from the website
<http://www.r-project.org>.  Some good introductions to the language
are [VR00](#ref), [VR02](#ref), [KZ08](#ref), and [VSR](#ref) and you
can download free manuals at
<http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals.html>.

One more point: I've found that, except with a few exceptions,
students' R code is usually unreadable.  Please read [Hadley Wickham's
R style guide](https://github.com/hadley/devtools/wiki/Style) early in
the semester.  It will give you a basic idea of good style for R
programming.

Reading
-------

The required textbooks are [CB02](#ref), [Gre12](#ref), and [KZ08](#ref).
[CB02](#ref) gives a good explanation of basic probability and statistics.
[Gre12](#ref) will be a useful reference later in your career and covers
many econometric estimators.  [KZ08](#ref) is relatively cheap and is also
available online through the library (we have an institutional
subscription to SpringerLink, which is the publisher's website for
e-books).  You may want to save pdf versions of its chapters to your
computer instead of purchasing the book from the bookstore.  You
should also download and install the R package that accompanies this
book, called the *AER* package.  You'll be required to buy
[Hay00](#ref) next semester, so you may want to buy it now as another
source of material.

This would also be a good time for you to begin reading the *Journal
of Economic Literature* and paying attention to working papers in your
field announced at <http://nep.repec.org>.

Course outline
--------------

The first exam will cover parts 1 and 2 below, the second exam will
cover part 3, and the final exam is cumulative. I will announce
specific readings as the semester progresses.

1. Overview of probability
2. Point estimation and identification
3. Inference
4. Additional topics in linear regression

University policies
-------------------

The following policies apply to *every* course at Iowa State
University. They are listed here for your convenience and reference.

### Academic dishonesty

The class will follow Iowa State University's policy on academic
dishonesty.  Anyone suspected of academic dishonesty will be reported
to the Dean of Students Office,
<http://www.dso.iastate.edu/ja/academic/misconduct.html>.

### Disability accommodation

This material can be provided to you in alternative format. Anyone who
anticipates difficulties with the content or format of the course due
to a physical or learning disability should see me immediately in
order to work out a plan. You may also want to contact the Disability
Resources (DR) office, located on the main floor of the Student
Services Building, Room 1076 or call them at 515-294-7220.

### Dead week

For academic programs, the last week of classes is considered to be a
normal week in the semester except that in developing their syllabi
faculty shall consider the following guidelines:

* Mandatory final examinations in any course may not be given during
  Dead Week except for laboratory courses and for those classes
  meeting once a week only and for which there is no contact during
  the normal final exam week. Take home final exams and small quizzes
  are generally acceptable. (For example, quizzes worth no more than
  10 percent of the final grade and/or that cover no more than
  one-fourth of assigned reading material in the course could be
  given).

* Major course assignments should be assigned prior to Dead Week
  (major assignments include major research papers, projects,
  etc.). Any modifications to assignments should be made in a timely
  fashion to give students adequate time to complete the assignments.

* Major course assignments should be due no later than the Friday
  prior to Dead Week. Exceptions include class presentations by
  students, semester-long projects such as a design project in lieu of
  a final, and extensions of the deadline requested by students.

### Harassment and discrimination

Iowa State University strives to maintain our campus as a place of
work and study for faculty, staff, and students that is free of all
forms of prohibited discrimination and harassment based upon race,
ethnicity, sex (including sexual assault), pregnancy, color, religion,
national origin, physical or mental disability, age, marital status,
sexual orientation, gender identity, genetic information, or status as
a U.S. veteran. Any student who has concerns about such behavior
should contact his/her instructor, Student Assistance at 515-294-1020,
or the Office of Equal Opportunity and Compliance at 515-294-7612.

### Religious accommodation

If an academic or work requirement conflicts with your religious
practices and/or observances, you may request reasonable
accommodations. Your request must be in writing, and your instructor
or supervisor will review the request.  You or your instructor may
also seek assistance from the Dean of Students Office or the Office of
Equal Opportunity and Compliance.

### Contact information

If you feel that any of your rights as a student have been violated,
please email <academicissues@iastate.edu>.
