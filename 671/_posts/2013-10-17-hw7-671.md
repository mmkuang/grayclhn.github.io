Do empirical applications 4.1, 4.2, 5.2, and 5.3 in Greene as well as
questions 8.13, 8.16, and 8.46 in Casella and Berger.  Also, consider
these variations of 8.16:

* Choose α to always force rejection, but with α restricted to [0, 0.1].

* Choose α to always force acceptance, but (again) with α restricted
  to [0, 0.1].
