Please do the following questions in Casella and Berger: 6.35–6.37,
7.6, and 7.19–7.21 as well as the following questions:

1) Prove that max_i X_i is sufficient for b if X_1,...,X_n are
   i.i.d. uniform(0,b)

2) Write an R function that calculates the maximum likelihood
   estimator of a and b for the gamma(a,b) distribution. Maximize the
   likelihood function numerically even if you are able to
   analytically derive the MLE.  You may find the R functions `optim`
   and `dgamma` helpful.  You should pay attention to the initial
   values of the numerical optimization procedure, and may want to use
   the method of moments to derive sensible initial values.
