Do questions 1.24, 1.25, and 1.26 from Casella and Berger (2002), and
questions 8, 9, and 27 in Gallant (1997) as well as the following
computational question:

Suppose that X has a continuous distribution F and that
U ∼ uniform(0,1).  It can be shown that F(X) = U in distribution
and, consequently, that X = F⁻¹(U) in distribution (proven as Theorem
2.1.10 in Casella and Berger).  Use this result to write an R function
called `rtan` that generates n random variables from the
location-scale family μ + σ X, where X ∼ F and

F(x) = 0.5 + tan⁻¹(x)/π.

The arguments of the function should include n, μ, and σ.
