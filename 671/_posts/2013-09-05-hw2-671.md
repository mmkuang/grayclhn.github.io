Do

* questions 6 and 11 from Gallant ch 2 and questions 2, 3, and 13 from
  Gallant ch 3

* question 4.20 from Casella and Berger

Also do the following questions:

* Let X and Y be two random variables. Prove that

    var(X) = E var(X | Y) + var(E(X | Y))

* Write an R function to generate draws from the density function in
  question 13, ch 3 of Greene using the Accept-Reject algorithm
  described in Section 5.6.2 of Casella and Berger (2002):

  1. Draw U ~ uniform(0,1) and X ~ uniform(-1,1).
  2. If U ≤ (1-X²), accept and store the value of X. Otherwise draw
     U and X again.
  3. Repeat until you accept and store n candidate values of X.

  This process generates n independent draws from the density
  A (1-x²) 1{-1 ≤ x ≤ 1 }.  Notice that it does not require us to know
  the normalizing constant A.  This is common for this sort of
  algorithm.  Use this function to verify your answers to question 13
  (and include output).
