Please do questions 5.8, 7.41–7.43, 7.45 (see errata for corrections),
and 7.54 in Casella and Berger.  Also conduct a Monte Carlo analysis
of the estimator in 7.54 as follows:

a) Write an R function that generates data from the listed density
function.

b) Write R functions that estimate the best unbiased estimator and the
bias corrected MLE.

c) Draw 10000 observations from the density and estimate the variance
of each estimator.  Do this for a few different values θ (say, θ = -1,
0, 1, and 5).  Do these simulations agree with your answers to part 7.54?
