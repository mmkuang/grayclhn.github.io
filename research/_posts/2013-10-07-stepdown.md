This paper proposes new stepdown methods for testing multiple
hypotheses and constructing confidence intervals while controlling the
familywise error rate and other generalized error rates.  One method
is a refinement of Romano and Wolf's StepM (2005, <i>Econometrica</i>)
that also removes inequalities that fall outside any
(1/<i>âˆšn</i>)-neighborhood of binding; it has the advantage that the
threshold construction is incorporated into the stepdown procedure so
it accounts for the number of total hypotheses (leading to better size
control than some alternative methods) and excludes more nonbinding
inequalities (leading to higher power).  This method can also be used
to test multiple inequality hypotheses simultaneously and construct
confidence intervals for partially identified parameters.  The paper
presents methods for controlling the <i>k</i>-familywise error rate
and the False Discovery Proportion for families of one and two-sided
hypotheses as well.  The paper also provides Monte Carlo evidence that
the methods perform well in finite samples.
