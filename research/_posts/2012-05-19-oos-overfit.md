This paper uses dimension asymptotics to study why overfit linear
regression models should be compared out-of-sample; we let the number
of predictors used by the larger model increase with the number of
observations so that their ratio remains uniformly positive. Under
this limit theory, the naive Diebold-Mariano-West out-of-sample test
can test hypotheses about a key quantity for evaluating forecasting
models---a time series analogue to the generalization error---as long
as the out-of-sample period is small relative to the total sample
size. Moreover, tests that are designed to reject if the larger model
is true, such as the usual in-sample Wald and LM tests and also Clark
and McCracken's (2001, 2005a), McCracken's (2007) and Clark and West's
(2006, 2007) out-of-sample statistics, will choose the larger model
too often when the smaller model is more accurate.
