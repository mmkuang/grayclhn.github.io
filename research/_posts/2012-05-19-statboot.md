This paper weakens the size and moment conditions needed for typical
block bootstrap methods (i.e. the moving blocks, circular blocks, and
stationary bootstraps) to be valid for the sample mean of
Near-Epoch-Dependent functions of mixing processes; they are
consistent under the weakest conditions that ensure the original
process obeys a Central Limit Theorem (those of de Jong, 1997,
*Econometric Theory*). In doing so, this paper extends de Jong's method
of proof, a blocking argument, to hold with random and unequal block
lengths. This paper also proves that bootstrapped partial sums satisfy
a Functional CLT under the same conditions.
