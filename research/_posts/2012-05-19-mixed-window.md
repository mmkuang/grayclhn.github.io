This paper proposes a modification of Clark and West's (2007,
*J. Econom.*) adjusted out-of-sample t-test. The alternative model is
still estimated with a fixed-length rolling window, but the benchmark
is estimated with a recursive window. The resulting statistic is
asymptotically normal even when the models are nested. Moreover, the
alternative model can be estimated using common model selection
methods, such as the AIC or BIC. This paper also presents a method to
compare multiple models simultaneously while controlling family-wise
error, and substantially improves existing block bootstrap methods for
out-of-sample statistics. This procedure is then used to analyze Goyal
and Welch's (2008, *Rev. Finan. Stud.*) excess returns dataset.
