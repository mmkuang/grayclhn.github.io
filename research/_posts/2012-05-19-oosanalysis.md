This library provides R functions to conduct pseudo out-of-sample
comparisons of forecasting models.  This package is written as a
literate program (see, e.g., [this
description](http://vasc.ri.cmu.edu/old_help/Programming/Literate/literate.html))
using [noweb](http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/noweb/). The oosanalysis
library is available under version 3 of the GPL.
