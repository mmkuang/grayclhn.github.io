title: The dbframe R library
link: https://www.github.com/gcalhoun/dbframe-R-library
---
This library sets up an interface between R and an SQL database using
the DBI library. dbframe is designed to make writing queries
easier. This package is written as a literate program (see, e.g.,
[this
description](http://vasc.ri.cmu.edu/old_help/Programming/Literate/literate.html))
using [noweb](http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/noweb/); the most immediate
implication of that statement is that you should not edit the R or Rd
files in the package because they are automatically generated by the
.rw files (in the "source" directory). The documentation and scripts
can be generated from these files using the tord noweb backend
([available here](/downloads/tord)), which is a slightly modified
version of noweb's original totex. The dbframe library is available
under version 3 of the GPL.
