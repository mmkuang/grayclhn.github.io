This paper derives the asymptotic distribution of the F-test for the
significance of linear regression coefficients as both the number of
regressors, k, and the number of observations, n, increase together so
that their ratio remains positive in the limit. The conventional
critical values for this test statistic are too small, and the
standard version of the F-test is invalid under this asymptotic
theory. This paper provides a correction to the F statistic that gives
correctly-sized tests under both this paper's limit theory and also
under conventional asymptotic theory that keeps k finite. This paper
also presents simulations that indicate the new statistic can perform
better in small samples than the conventional test. The statistic is
then used to reexamine Olivei and Tenreyro's results from "The Timing
of Monetary Policy Shocks" (2007, AER) and Sala-i-Martin's results
from "I Just Ran Two Million Regressions" (1997, AER.)
