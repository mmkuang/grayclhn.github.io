Hi everyone, I've just sent a revised copy of my block bootstrap paper
back to *Econometric Theory*, with a day to spare before the
resubmission deadline. The revised copy is now online at:

<http://www.econ.iastate.edu/research/working-papers/p14313>

and it has a separate appendix that is available
[here](dl/calhoun-bootstrap-appendix.pdf).

Let me know if you find any errors or have any comments. Thanks!
