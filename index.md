I’m Gray Calhoun, an Assistant Professor in the Economics Department
at Iowa State. I work on Econometric theory, especially time series
and applications to forecasting and forecast evaluation. I graduated
with a PhD from UC San Diego in 2009, where I worked with Graham
Elliott and Allan Timmermann.
