title: Clojure, Incanter, and xpxi

Update on 6/5

I've been told by an Incanter user that this post is too pessimistic.
I'll look into his specific critiques and write another post soon.

Original post
-------------

I’ve been casually interested in Lispy languages for a while; i.e. I’d
like to learn one and am not going to let the fact that I only know
bits of e-lisp after 15 years of using Emacs deter me.  Clojure seems
hot and I really like the talks I’ve seen by Rich Hickey, its creator.
[Simple Made Easy](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy#.UWTGZZuG4ks.wordpress)
is especially good.  Plus, Clojure even has a well-regarded statistics
library, [Incanter](http://incanter.org/), so awesome.

Anyway, procrastinating tonight, I decided to check out
[Incanter’s source code on Github](https://github.com/liebke/incanter).
I have a really simple method for evaluating open source statistics
packages: find the linear regression function, and look for variables
named xpxi or xtxi and, if they exist, basically avoid the package
(for some reason, these variable names are ubiquitous.).  Inverting
the *X’X* matrix is a pretty bad idea–it is a numerically unstable way
of calculating the regression coefficients that (in problems I’ve
worked on) sometimes leads to a non-idempotent projection matrix
*X(X’X)⁻¹X’* (or, using less terminology, *X’X(X’X)⁻¹* may not equal
the identity matrix).  Needless to say this results in pretty bad
estimates of the OLS coefficients.  [Douglas Bates talks about
performance issues in this R-news article](http://www.r-project.org/doc/Rnews/Rnews_2004-1.pdf#section*.31) too, but I’m much more
concerned about numeric instability.  I don’t necessarily have the
most informed opinion about the best way to get the OLS estimates, but
I’ve gotten good results from the QR decomposition.

As of today, you can probably guess, [Incanter fails this test](https://github.com/liebke/incanter/blob/master/modules/incanter-core/src/incanter/stats.clj#L2067).
The source code and documentation are pretty unconcerned with the
actual implementation of OLS, and I can’t figure out exactly what
algorithm solve uses (I’m unpersuaded by the claim that it is
“[equivalent to R’s solve function](https://github.com/liebke/incanter/blob/master/modules/incanter-core/src/incanter/core.clj#L682)”
and can’t really track it down any further than that part of the
code).

These details are important!  I mean, I appreciate the effort and the
good intentions that goes into developing open source packages like
this.  But if you’re developing statistical software for other people
to use, you really need to understand the numeric properties of the
routines you’re writing and you need to transparently communicate that
understanding to other people who might use your code.  So I guess
I’ll stick with R for a while longer.
