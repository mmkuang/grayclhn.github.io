title: Writing a free Econometrics textbook
author: Gray Calhoun
---

I'm starting an open-source project to produce a free Econometrics textbook from my lecture notes from the past few years.  The homepage is <http://www.econometricslibrary.org> and the source is on GitHub at <https://github.com/EconometricsLibrary>.

[I wrote a post on Medium giving some of my thoughts behind the project](https://medium.com/look-what-i-made/41c7faa51fa4).
