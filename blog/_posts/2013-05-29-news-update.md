title: More news on Visual Scoreboard

So, following up on the last post, I’ve had two phone interviews about my sports statistical graphics website: <http://visualscoreboard.com>. Hopefully I avoided saying anything too stupid, and hopefully I was interesting enough that they actually put parts of the interviews on the air. But it’s a little strange that there’s any interest at all.

At some point soon, I should probably make an effort to make that website intelligible to anyone other than myself. I think at one point I just decided that I was the only one looking at it, so I might as well not have captions. That may have been an error.
