title: NCAA picks

I probably should have mentioned at least my final four in my earlier
post:
* Louisville
* Gonzaga
* Kansas
* Miami (explanation below)

**Finals:** Gonzaga over Kansas.

Footnote: Miami is a bad choice; Indiana has a much better chance of
reaching the elite eight than Miami and is probably the better team,
so picking Indiana to make the final four is a no brainer. If I’d been
picking only on expected points, I’d pick Gonzaga over Indiana in the
finals (despite everyone’s opinion, every statistical method I tried
had Gonzaga as the favorite with about a 17%-20% chance of winning the
tournament.  Now that I’ve said that, watch them lose to Wichita State
in the second round).

But picking four #1 seeds to make the final four is really lame, so I
arbitrarily picked Miami for the upset. Plus, I entered this bracket
in some large pools and it seems like a decent strategy for a really
big pool is to make one idiosyncratic “bad” choice in the final four
and hope that it happens.
