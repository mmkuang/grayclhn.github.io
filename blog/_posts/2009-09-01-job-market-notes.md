I had promised that I'd consolidate the collected "job market wisdom"
of the 2009 graduating class and present it as a set of notes for
future classes.  I put it off (after getting a job, one still needs to
defend...) and I've forgotten a lot of the suggestions that other
people had.  So these notes largely reflect my own job market
experience.  I'll try to include other people's opinions when I can
remember them.  If you have comments or information that I missed,
please let me know.  Some people have and requested that they stay
anonymous, but I'm happy to attribute the advice to you if you want
credit.

Since these documents last longer than is originally intended, I
should give a little bit of background information.  I went to
graduate school at UCSD where I studied econometrics for six years.  I
went on the job market in the 2008-2009 academic year and defended in
July, 2009.  My first job out of grad school is an Assistant
Professorship in the Economics Department at Iowa State University.

Brief time frame for job market
-------------------------------

A basic timeline: what happens when; what you need to own or create by
that date; and what you probably want in addition to the bare minimum.

### mid-October through end of November

The deadlines for job applications largely fall in late October
through mid November.  About a quarter of the applications are due
after Thanksgiving.

* What you need (minimum)

  * **A generic cover letter:** Writing more than one cover letter per
  "class" of job application is overkill; I had one cover letter for
  research positions (regardless of the department), one for private
  sector jobs, and one for teaching positions.  They got tweaked a
  little for some of the positions, but not by more than a sentence or
  two (one example: I mentioned that "I worked closely with Dimitris
  Politis" when applying to statistics departments).  The cover letter
  needs to include this information:
  * your field (and secondary fields if they're relevant)
  * the position you're applying for (sometimes the letter goes to
    HR.  Sometimes the department is hiring for several positions
    and the same person handles all of it.  Etc.)
  * your advisors
  * the fact that you'll attend the AEA meetings (It is not always
    assumed that you're attending the AEA meetings.  I was asked
    about this by email a few times when I omitted it in the cover
    letter).

  * **A paper:** This should go without saying.  I was surprised by how
  many people read my job market paper, though.  Before going through
  the process, I had the impression that job market papers were not
  actually read, but that the interview decision was made largely on
  letters of recommendation.  I was wrong.

  * **Three letters of recommendation.**

  * **A one to two page summary of your dissertation.**

  * **A CV:** The department will encourage you to use its template,
  which is (unfortunately) very ugly.  It probably doesn't matter if
  it is ugly... but I didn't use their template.  I also didn't use my
  current online CV, which is also ugly.

  * **A webpage.**

  * **A photograph.**

* What you might need (Required by many schools)

  * You don't need to put much effort into these elements of your
  application, unless you badly want a teaching job.  But many schools
  will consider your application incomplete if it doesn't have these
  items included.

  * A summary of teaching evaluations.

  * A one-page "statement of teaching philosophy".


* What you want (highly recommended)

  * **Another paper:** "Highly recommended" is an understatement.  I
  have heard rumors that the department (UCSD) will re-evaluate where
  they'll push a candidate on completion of a second paper.

  * **Another letter of recommendation.**

  * **A resume:** If a job asks for "a resume," it does not mean "a
  CV".  A resume should have different information than a CV; for
  example, computer skills and non-research work experience.
  Obviously, if you are only applying to academic jobs, you don't need
  a resume and, knowing that, you may not want to put your resume on
  your website (having the resume on your website signals that you're
  applying to non-research jobs, which signals that you're not
  confident about your ability to land a research job, which signals
  lower ability... I'm overthinking this, but not really kidding)

* Misc points.

  * Other academic departments (other than economics--statistics or
  public policy, for example) may be slightly earlier or later.
  Government departments that don't hire many Ph.D. economists also
  can operate on a different application schedule (the State
  Department, as a hypothetical example), so (if they hire later) they
  can be useful for hedging.  You should be aware that these
  departments typically pay noticeably less than institutions that
  hire lots of economists.

  * There's disagreement on whether you should or should not apply for
  jobs that are 'out of reach'.  I did.  The cost of applying to any
  given job is tiny, and it seemed like getting my paper read by as
  many people as possible had benefits on its own.  I didn't see a
  downside, and don't know what the counterargument is; but it does
  apparently exist.

  * It is often easier to apply for a job than to determine whether or
  not you are a good fit for that job.  If you find yourself agonizing
  and trying to decide whether you should apply, save yourself some
  time and apply.

  * Economics Department jobs are posted on JOE (the AEA's website),
  ERN, FRN, Walras.org, inomics, UK-JOE.  Most business schools,
  government agencies, and private companies looking for
  Ph.D. Economists post to JOE as well.  European departments
  sometimes post here, sometimes post elsewhere.  Many smaller, less
  prestigious liberal arts colleges won't post anywhere but will have
  faculty jobs listed on their HR website.

  * Other types of jobs can be posted elsewhere
    * Public Policy: <http://www.appam.org/home.asp> (APPAM)
    * Health Economics: <http://www.academyhealth.org/> (AcademyHealth)
    * Statistics:
      * IMS: <http://jobs.imstat.org/>
      * ASA: <http://www.amstat.org/jobweb/index.cfm>
      * Online Stats Job site: <http://www.stat.ufl.edu/vlib/jobs.html>

  * This process is stressful and busy for everyone.

  * **About organization**: I kept an Excel file where each row contained
  all of the information for a given job: deadline, department,
  contact info, JEL codes, etc.  In retrospect, this was complete
  overkill.  I made slight errors in transcribing the information, and
  I went back and checked the original listing before writing each
  cover letter.  The point is, you're only sending 200 job packets at
  most, so automating and computerizing the process is silly.  If I
  were doing it over, I'd print out each job listing and keep it in a
  binder sorted by the application deadline.

### First two to three weeks after Thanksgiving

Schools will contact you about interviews at the meetings

* misc points

  * This is more stressful, but not particularly busy

  * Your advisor and committee can make phone calls.  Ask them to if
  you're not getting interviews. This stage is the one that your
  advisor's pull matters.  They can get you interviews at the AEA
  meetings, not flyouts and certainly not jobs.

  * There are sales (Macy's, after Thanksgiving, etc.) that are
  especially helpful for buying luggage and suits.  Shopping would be
  a nice way to blow off steam.

  * Generally, people perform worse in their first few interviews,
  perform best in the early afternoon on the first day, and perform
  worse again as they get fatigued later in the day and on the second
  and third days.  If you could schedule your interviews to reflect
  that pattern, it would be great.  But you really can't.  You will
  get calls about interviews over about a two week period; suppose the
  first interview you get is very prestigious, and the next interview
  is much less.  You have no way of knowing where they fall in the
  distribution of interviews you're going to have.  By the time you've
  scheduled enough interviews to know how you should schedule them,
  it's too late.

  * One thing you can do is know how far it is between hotels; this is
  hard to do if you haven't lived in the city, so ask someone who has.
  Last year (January of 2009), some people didn't realize that SF has hills, and walking
  up those hills is more difficult than walking down.

### First few days of January

The AEA meetings

* What you need: Practice describing your job market paper and dissertation!

* Misc points

  * You really are running from hotel room to hotel room for three (or
  more) days; one of the only things I was surprised about was how
  much my feet hurt.

  * You need to practice a lot for the interviews.  Practice with
  friends.  There are lists online of potential questions specific to
  the Economics job market.  The basic format is:

  * you sit down, someone says, "tell us about your research"
    with some amusement

  * you describe your job market paper -- they may interrupt
    with questions and they may not

  * You want this period to be very busy.  It may or may not be stressful

  * If you are invited to a reception, you should go.  Even though
  you'll be tired and feel exhausted.  I skipped some and was asked
  (by one of them) why I didn't attend, so apparently people do
  notice.

  * It is hard to describe how different various people's experience was
  at SF last year.  Some people had a great time and enjoyed meeting
  with everyone.  Other people had interviews that they thought were
  hostile and unpleasant.  In general, the people who resolved
  beforehand that the experience would be fun usually had fun --
  obviously, there's a huge amount of endogeneity in that statement,
  but it does mean that your experience is heavily influenced by your
  attitude even if (and I don't believe this) your outcomes are not.

  * If you have co-authored papers (I didn't, but this advice comes from
  someone who did), expect to be asked where the idea came from, who
  did what, etc.  I assume this is even more likely if it is your job
  market paper.

  * Some research has been done on what happens in a "bad" job market.
  In short, the best candidates get more interviews and other
  candidates get fewer and worse interviews.  Whether or not you
  believe the results, this research suggests that whenever you're
  asked how the job market is going (by someone other than a close
  confidant) you should reply, "I'm really happy with the interviews I
  have and I'm busier than I expected to be."  It's plausibly true,
  it's a subtle signal that you're a "good" candidate, and (most
  importantly) it's a much more pleasant answer than, "this year sucks
  and I hate all of my interviews," especially when you are asked the
  question during an interview.

### January and February

Flyouts and job negotiation

* What you need

  * **A reliable laptop:** If you have any doubt about the reliability
  of your laptop, buy a new one.  The tiny netbooks only cost a few
  hundred dollars.

  * **Slides:** Specifically, polished job market presentation that runs
  1:15 to 1:30 Different departments have different length seminars.
  You should be practicing a lot.  You should also be aware that the
  conference rooms vary a lot.  You're used to a short and wide
  seminar room, others can be very long and skinny.

* Misc points

  * Basic schedule of a flyout:
    * You usually arrive the day/night before
    * You'll have dinner the night you interview or the night
      before. Sometimes, the "official" dinner will be the night after
      you interview, but people will want to take you out to an
      "unofficial" dinner the night before; so arrive early the
      day before if you can to keep that night's dinner free.
    * Leave town that night or the next morning

  * Interviews with the faculty run about half an hour to an hour.  you
  may talk be about your paper, maybe about the university, maybe
  about misc. topics (the Detroit lions losing, for example, or about
  the university's retirement plan).  The most fun interviews are when
  you talk about the other person's research.

  * Basic format of dinner:
    * It may or may not be an 'interview,' depending on who is free
      that night.
    * If it is an interview, one standard format is to ask technical
      questions over dessert.  This can be done pleasantly or not; at
      ISU, I was politely asked to explain how I planned to do a few
      technical extensions to my job market paper that I'd discussed
      earlier.  So, you should not drink at dinner.

  * An anonymous reader had the following comment: 'It might be obvious,
  but the job interview is the entire time you are with potential
  colleagues on the fly-out -- this includes dinners and happy hours
  and drinks and whatever.  Some freshwater schools, in particular,
  will wait to ask hard questions at the end of a dinner including
  drinks, and perhaps even a happy hour before that.  Be professional
  the whole time and be ready to be on your game (your research, the
  particulars of what your job market does) whenever you are around
  these potential colleagues.  Remember two parts to the term
  "potential colleagues": the "potential" means you have to know your
  stuff around them, and they are very interested to know if you know;
  the "colleague" means it pays to show that you are a human being
  that can be sociable, and so isn't a drag to have around.'

  * Contacting institutions about nearby interviews is okay.  This
  caused me some stress about what "nearby" means when you're flying
  out of San Diego, especially because people here have misconceptions
  about actual distance between cities on the east coast.  I still
  don't know.

  * After you get an offer, you can and should contact everyone else
  that you interviewed with---they understand how the process works
  and understand that you're on a deadline.  If you hadn't heard from
  them since the AEA meetings, it's almost certain that they'll tell
  you, "thanks for letting us know.  We're going to hire someone
  else."  But it's still important; it's good for 'networking;' and
  they'll probably say something like, "I really liked your research,"
  which will make you feel good about yourself.

  * Fly direct whenever possible.  There's a temptation to try to save
  the department paying for your flyout a little bit of money, but you
  are going to be very tired and probably sick, and missing a
  connecting flight could be a disaster.  No one ever was offered a
  job for saving the department $300 on a plane ticket.

  * Hopefully this is busy.  It is extremely stressful.

What we did
-----------

Here are a few things we did when I was on the job market that you might find helpful.

* We set up a different mailing list.  People had to opt in to it, the
  idea being that people are sometimes shy about sharing information
  because they don't want to come across as gloating or hurt someone's
  feelings if the job market is going particularly badly.  If people
  opt in to a second mailing list, you can be at least somewhat
  comfortable that they value the information.  Almost everyone
  participated.

* For the same reason, we set up a shared spreadsheet with everyone's
  interview information.  A spreadsheet format makes a little more
  sense for organizing this information, and getting regular email
  updates of everyone else's great interviews is extremely irritating.
  So we set up the spreadsheet separately.

* We held practice interviews.  The Federal Reserve interviews on
  campus before any of the scheduled faculty interviews, and we wanted
  to practice for those interviews too.  Also, there are only two
  interviews with faculty, and we wanted to practice a little bit more
  than that.  I think that some of us did about 5-10 practice
  interviews overall.

* We attended each other's practice job talk seminars, and scheduled
  extras.  Again, the job talk matters, so having lots of practice is
  helpful.

Other points
------------

### Networking

This subsection is speculative; I didn't do many of these things,
but in retrospect wish that I had.  So take it for what it's worth.

* The job market is an excellent time to start "networking".  After
  the job market, you're going to have a job (I am sure of this.  It
  is a tautology).  One aspect of any job is "building a professional
  network."  If you were smart, you started this in grad school by
  meeting speakers, going to conferences, following up with people,
  paying attention to who's working on what, etc.  But, like most of
  us, you probably did an incomplete job of it.  This year, you are
  going to meet a lot of people at a lot of different institutions,
  and many of them are going to have very similar research interests
  to yours--there's a lot of self-selection.  So, approach the job
  market from two angles: you do want a job, but you also want to
  start meeting future collaborators.  This means: follow up with
  people, write thank you notes after interviewing, try to talk to
  them about their research and discuss common interests, etc.

* You will be very tempted to skip departmental seminars during the
  Fall quarter and consequently avoid meeting the speakers.  Don't.
  There are many obvious reasons that you should continue to go to the
  seminars and meet the speakers; I assume you can see them yourself.
  Another, not at all obvious reason is that you are likely to take a
  job at a department that does not have regular seminars in your
  field -- many departments have a single, weekly, "department
  seminar" that hosts all outside speakers.  So this could be your
  last year (for the foreseeable future) of working at a department
  that has regular seminars in your field.  Take advantage of it while
  it lasts.

* A note about thank-you notes.  They're not necessary, but they're
  nice.  Despite what you read in job-search books, write emails and
  not hand-written letters.  People can and do reply to emails.
  Moreover, since no one checks his or her department mailbox
  regularly, you can't be sure that a hand-written letter would even
  be received.  Sending or not sending a note will make no difference
  on whether or not you are hired, but getting hired shouldn't be your
  only goal this year.

* Different advisors handle the job market differently.  Some advisors
  are very upbeat before the market, some are very negative, some are
  very hands-on, some aren't.  Often candidates in consecutive years
  who share the same advisor will have interviews at many of the same
  places. So it probably makes sense to contact your advisor's
  previous advisees and ask them about their job market experience and
  what you should expect.
  1. It's useful information on its own
  2. You are doing similar research to your advisor's previous
  advisees, so you should know them.  Even if you were friends in
  grad school, it may have been a few years since you last talked.

* For exactly the same reason, you may want to contact recent UCSD
  grads who work in your field (Micro Theory, for example).

* For private sector jobs, and probably some government jobs, the
  stereotypical private sector job search advice applies: talk to
  people inside the companies you're considering working at, and if
  you don't know someone working there, ask someone who does to
  introduce you.  One of the job market guides (I think Stanford's)
  says (in a different context) that a job at an economic consulting
  company is a sure thing for any of their graduates, which would
  suggest that trying to get those jobs is a waste of time.  This may
  or may not be true for UCSD graduates in a typical year, but
  probably isn't true in an exceptionally bad year.  Moreover, it
  ignores an important point.  There are huge differences in working
  at one company vs. another, in one branch vs. another, and in one
  city vs. another.  Some of these differences are apparent to outside
  applicants, but most aren't; and some are clear but there's no
  reliable way for an outside applicant to control how the application
  is handled.  The point of talking to people is to ensure that the
  right branch/department in the right city in the right company is
  handling your application and to make sure that you know what the
  "right" one is for all of those variables.

### Misc. points

* Do not isolate yourself from other grad students.  This year is
  extremely stressful, and almost no one else you know can empathize
  with what you're going through (it's like being a teenager). Talk to
  each other.  Go out to dinner at the AEA meetings.  Text each other.
  One nice feature of the shared spreadsheet was that it removed
  uncertainty about how other people are doing -- which is nice on its
  own, but also helped make it easier to talk about the job
  market... instead of asking Chris (for example) "how's it going?"
  and worrying that he'll respond by crying, I could say,
  "congratulations on that new interview" or "man, why the hell aren't
  more places lining up to interview you?"

* Do not isolate yourself from your family.  Where you move affects
  your family too.  Your spouse is also extremely stressed out.  This
  can go a bit too far, though: I met a few candidate's spouses at the
  AEA meetings and found it a bit weird.

* You may have noticed that this outline did not mention any of the
  economics job-market rumor boards, wikis, etc.  They don't have much
  information, people on them lie, and it's depressing and stressful
  to read the messages.  I avoided them.  They may have improved since
  I was on the job market, but I doubt it.

Revision history
----------------

* I originally wrote this document in August and September of 2009.

* Since then, I have made a few minor changes to its formatting and
  phrasing, but I don't remember making any substantive changes.

* The last such change was made on August 2, 2012.

* I plan to keep better records in the future.
