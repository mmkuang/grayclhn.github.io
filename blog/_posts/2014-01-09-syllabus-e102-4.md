This class has two main goals. It will train you to better understand
global and national Macroeconomic events (recessions, expansions,
etc.), including the recent financial crisis and the current economic
slump.  And it will also give you the necessary background for future
classes in Economics and Business.

The course is divided into three parts:

1. The U.S. Macroeconomy overall: what the important series are and
   how recessions and expansions propegate.

2. How macroeconomic policy is conducted, given what we discussed in
   the first part of the course.

3. Issues relevant to international (open-economy) Macroeconomics:
   long-run economic growth; capital flows and trade between countries;
   and exchange rates.

The first two parts will be followed by midterm exams and the last
part will be followed by the final.

**This is important:** I am teaching two sections of Econ 102 this
semester; they both meet MWF and they both meet in the same room of
the same building. Please make sure that you use the correct syllabus.

Textbooks
---------

### Required
There is one required text that the lectures will follow closely:

* [Macroeconomics, Third
  edition](http://bcs.worthpublishers.com/krugmanwellsmacro3), by Paul
  Krugman and Robin Wells.  The third edition has some new material on
  the recent financial crisis.

### Recommended
The next books are not required but are useful.  Both use less math
and provide different perspectives than the textbook.

* [The Little Book of Economics, 2nd edition](http://gregip.wordpress.com/),
  by Greg Ip. This book describes Macroeconomics with very few
  equations, charts, or graphs.  It also talks about the recent
  financial crisis. This book can help if you want to understand how
  the topics covered by the textbook and lectures apply to current
  events.

* [Diary of a Very Bad Year: Confessions of an Anonymous Hedge Fund
  Manager](http://shop.nplusonemag.com/products/diary-of-a-very-bad-year-confessions-of-an-anonymous-hedge-fund-manager),
  by Keith Gessen.  This book comes from a series of interviews that
  the editor of a literary journal (n+1) did with a hedge fund manager
  during the recent financial crisis.

### News and current events
Macroeconomics has dominated the news lately.  You are not required to
follow current events in this class, but you may find doing so
interesting and useful.  The following sources have particularly
strong coverage of Economics:

* [The Financial Times](http://www.ft.com), a daily newspaper.

* [The Economist](http://www.economist.com), a weekly news magazine.
