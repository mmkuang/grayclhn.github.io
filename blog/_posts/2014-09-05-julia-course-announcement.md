Something I probably should have mentioned two weeks ago: [Heike
Hofmann][1] is teaching a 1 credit Julia Seminar in the Iowa State
Statistics Department this semester. It meets Wednesdays from 12 â€“ 1,
and so far has gone through something close to the content's of [Leah
Hanson's][2] "[Learn Julia in Y minutes][3]." You can see the schedule
on the course's GitHub page, <https://github.com/heike/stat590f>, and
it should be interesting and fun.
