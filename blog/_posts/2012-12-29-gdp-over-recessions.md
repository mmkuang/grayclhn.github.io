title: Pictures of GDP over recessions
---

I’m starting to prepare to teach Principles of Macroeconomics next semester, so I’m trying to think of interesting and useful ways to show the students Economic data. Especially how key series behave over the business cycle (i.e. during and after a recession).

Here are some preliminary ideas for plotting real GDP. Since I want to highlight the recessions, I’ve split the series into blocks: for each recession, we’re going to treat that recession as well as the expansions that come immediately before and after it as a block of real GDP, and compare the blocks to each other (the blocks have overlapping observations, which is fine). To make it easy to compare the blocks, they’re all aligned at the end of their respective recessions, so the time axis in the plots is years before or after the recession ends, and they’re recentered vertically; the vertical axis is “real GDP as a percent of the average value during the recession” (using a log scale) but that was chosen by trial and error.

The plots are presented below; each plot presents all of the 11 post-war recessions, but each plot highlights a different one—I hope it’s obvious that the black line is the highlighted recession and the translucent lines show the other recessions for comparison. It’s clear that the typical recession has been followed by a short recovery period of high growth followed by an expansion with slower growth at about the same rate as before the recession. The most recent recession (the top graph) has been longer and has had a steeper and larger fall in GDP, and the subsequent recovery has been much slower than past recoveries. Moreover, there hasn’t been any period of higher growth; the entire recovery has been at more or less the same rate. So, that’s bad for the U.S., but it’s interesting to see it so clearly in these pictures.
