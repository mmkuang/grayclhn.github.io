Hi everyone, I'm reorganizing my assorted websites and domains. I do
this from time to time and it's unclear why. I seem to be using this
site and my twitter account regularly, and Jess posts pictures to our
[family Tumblr][1] pretty regularly too. I have an unfounded belief
that I'll post interesting and witty things to [my Tumblr][2], so I'm
keeping it up, but in reality it will remain unused.

I still need to set up an RSS feed for this website. Once I do, you
can follow it for updates, etc.
