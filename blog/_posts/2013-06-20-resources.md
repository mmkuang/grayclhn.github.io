title: Statistics and R resources
author: Gray Calhoun

I'm working with an undergraduate student who, quite reasonably, asked
for some recommendations for books to learn more about R and
statistical analysis.  Naturally, I stalled because I didn't have a
great answer off the top of my head.  Now that I've looked into it
some more, I still don't have a great answer, but I might have an
acceptable one.

Statistics & Graphics
---------------------

This is probably not a standard list, but... I've learned an immense
amount from:

* Cleveland's books, especially *Visualizing Data*
* Manski's *Identification Problems in the Social Sciences*
* Tufte's four books
  * *The Visual Display of Quantitative Information*
  * *Envisioning Information*
  * *Visual Explanations*
  * *Beautiful Evidence*
* Howard Wainer's books are excellent, especially
  *Picturing the Uncertain World*
* Frank Harrell's *Regression Modeling Strategies* is very good.

At first, I really disliked Stephen Few's *Show me the numbers:
Designing Tables and Graphs to Enlighten* and viewed it as Tufte-lite.
I still kind of think that, but some people might need to start with
Tufte-lite, so there's probably a role for the book.  Plus,
[his blog][0] is enjoyably opinionated (but, damn, the only "sharing"
options on each post are del.icio.us and Digg This.  Makes me feel
old.)

Using R
-------

I really don't know; I'd been programming for a long time before I
started using R, so I've never had a "complete beginner" perspective.
These look decent, though, and are either free or cheap:

Free:

* Start by at least looking at the [R introductory manual][1]; the
  [other manuals][2] are less
  useful at first, but the data import/export info might be helpful.
* And [the FAQ][3], along with [the platform-specific FAQ][4] if you
  use Windows or Mac.  Especially read the answer to
  "[What documentation exists for R?][5]"
* [Alzola and Harrell's overview is pretty good][6]
* The R homepage has a [list of books and tutorials as well][7]

[7]: http://cran.r-project.org/other-docs.html

Cheap:

* *The R Graphics Cookbook*
* *The R Cookbook*
* *R in Action*

I should note that the Iowa State Library claims to have online access
for all three of them.  The "cookbooks" really have a "cookbook"
approach: you look up what you want to do and it gives you the steps
in R.

Both
----

* *Data analysis and graphics using R: an example-based approach*
  looks interesting and Cambridge University Press publishes some
  pretty spectacular and reasonably priced textbooks, so it may be
  worth checking out.
* I've heard good things about Gelman and Hill's Data Analysis Using
  *Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models* , and I like
  [Gelman's blog][8], so it might be worth
  looking at more.
