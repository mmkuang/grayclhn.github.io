title: Statistics and R resources
author: Gray Calhoun

I'm working with an undergraduate student who, quite reasonably, asked
for some recommendations for books to learn more about R and
statistical analysis.  Naturally, I stalled because I didn't have a
great answer off the top of my head.  Now that I've looked into it
some more, I still don't have a great answer, but I might have an
acceptable one.

Statistics & Graphics
---------------------

This is probably not a standard list, but... I've learned an immense
amount from:

* Cleveland's books, especially [Visualizing Data] (http://amzn.com/0963488406)
* Manski's [Identification Problems in the Social Sciences] (http://amzn.com/0674442849)
* Tufte's four books
  * [The Visual Display of Quantitative Information] (http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi)
  * [Envisioning Information] (http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_ei)
  * [Visual Explanations] (http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_visex)
  * [Beautiful Evidence] (http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_be)
* Howard Wainer's books are excellent, especially
  [Picturing the Uncertain World] (http://amzn.com/0691152675)

At first, I really disliked Stephen Few's
[Show me the numbers: Designing Tables and Graphs to Enlighten]
(http://amzn.com/0970601972) and viewed it as Tufte-lite.  I still
kind of think that, but some people might need to start with
Tufte-lite, so there's probably a role for the book.  Plus, [his blog]
(http://www.perceptualedge.com/blog/) is enjoyably opinionated (but,
damn, the only "sharing" options on each post are del.icio.us and Digg
This.  Makes me feel old.)

Using R
-------

I really don't know; I'd been programming for a long time before I
started using R, so I've never had a "complete beginner" perspective.
These look decent, though, and are either free or cheap:

Free:

* Start by at least looking at the [R introductory manual]
  (http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html); the
  [other manuals] (http://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html) are less
  useful at first, but the data import/export info might be helpful.
* And [the FAQ] (http://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html), along
  with [the platform-specific FAQ]
  (http://cran.r-project.org/faqs.html) if you use Windows or Mac.
  Especially read the answer to "[What documentation exists for R?]
  (http://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#What-documentation-exists-for-R_003f)"
* [Alzola and Harrell's overview is pretty good]
  (http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/pub/Main/RS/sintro.pdf)
* The R homepage has a [list of books and tutorials as well]
  (http://cran.r-project.org/other-docs.html).

Cheap:

* [The R Graphics Cookbook] (http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023135.do)
* [The R Cookbook] (http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596809164.do)
* [R in Action] (http://www.manning.com/kabacoff/)

I should note that the Iowa State Library claims to have online access
for all three of them.  The "cookbooks" really have a "cookbook"
approach: you look up what you want to do and it gives you the steps
in R.

Both
----

* [Data analysis and graphics using R: an example-based approach]
  (http://amzn.com/0521762936) looks interesting and Cambridge
  University Press publishes some pretty spectacular and reasonably
  priced textbooks, so it may be worth checking out.
* I've heard good things about Gelman and Hill's
  [Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models]
  (http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/), and I like
  [Gelman's blog] (http://andrewgelman.com/), so it might be worth
  looking at more.
