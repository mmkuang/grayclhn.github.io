Going through very old email...

Before I moved out of the Bay Area, in August of 2003, I made a CD backup of my old “important” email. I haven’t looked at it since, but I’m going through it tonight. Some highlights:

* Welcome to Amazon.com (January 1, 2003)

* Invitation to join Friendster from Gray Calhoun (July 28, 2003)

And then there were a whole lot of emails about the Kickball team my friend organized.
