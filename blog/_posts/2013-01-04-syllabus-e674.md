Macroeconometrics is important; this class will help you get started.
The semester will be split into three parts.  Gray Calhoun will teach
the first and third part and Helle Bunzel will teach the middle part.
So this syllabus mainly applies to the first four weeks of the
semester and you may be given supplemental syllabi later on.  There is
no assigned textbook for the class, but the textbooks assigned for the
core Econometrics sequence cover some of the material.

Grading
-------

Your final grade for the semester will be based on an original
research paper due in July.  You will be required to submit a proposal
and a first draft during the semester, and Helle or I will discuss
your proposal with you after you submit it.  Your course grade will be
listed as "incomplete" until you turn in the paper, and the quality of
the proposal and the first draft will factor into your grade on the
paper.

Course outline
--------------

The first four weeks will cover basic time series concepts--weak
dependence concepts, stationarity, ARMA models, etc.--as well as
vector autoregressions (VARs).  The next seven and a half weeks will
cover special issues introduced by economic time series: deterministic
and stochastic trends in the data, variance estimation in the presence
of serial correlation, and bootstrapping dependent processes, among
other topics.  The remaining three and a half weeks will cover
macroeconometric modeling: estimation of DSGE models and
cointegration.  References will be supplied throughout the semester.
