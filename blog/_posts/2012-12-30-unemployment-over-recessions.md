title: Pictures of the unemployment rate over recessions
---

Following up on [my last post, that plotted real GDP over the post-war
recessions and exansions](/blog/2012/12/29/gdp-over-recessions), here’s a similar set of plots for the
[unemployment
rate](http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/UNRATE). Again, I’ve
taken overlapping blocks of the series and aligned them at the end of
each recession, so we can look at the pattern of the series through
the recession and subsequent recovery.

The plots are below; obviously, the most recent recession caused a
massive increase in the unemployment rate. But what I’m most surprised
by is how ordinary the recovery looks—the unemployment rate has been
falling slowly, but that’s happened in many earlier recessions. In the
two preceding recessions, the unemployment rate even rose after the
recession ended (slower than during the recession, but still…). I had
thought that the unemployment rate fell quickly immediately after
recessions and then slowed down later, but that pattern’s not
especially common and, where it happens, the slowdown is dramatic:
compare the most recent recovery to that of the 1981-1982 recession.
