## About me:

I need to fill this page in some more, but this is a start.  I'm an
Assistant Professor at Iowa State where I teach Economics and
Econometrics (that information is probably on the site's front page).
Before moving to Iowa, I lived in California for eight years; six in
grad school at UC San Diego and two before that in the San Francisco
bay area.  I went to Tufts University (it's outside Boston) for
undergrad where I majored in Mathematics and went to high school
outside of Philadelphia.

In addition to the links elsewhere on the site, I have a few others:

* The ambitiously-named [Econometrics Free Library
  Project](http://www.econometricslibrary.org) was set up to develop
  free/open-source Econometrics textbooks collaboratively.  Please see
  the website for information on participating and downloading the
  texts.

* I've set up the website <http://visualscoreboard.com> to host
  statistical graphics related to sports.

* I've set up a blog for updates on my family and kids; email me if
  you want the URL and please remind me why you should have it.

* The site feed, [gray.clhn.co/rss.xml](/rss.xml), is for
  announcements: presentations, papers, etc. I used to use it as a
  linkblog too, but I'm using a real blog now instead:
  [pseudotrue.com](http://pseudotrue.com).

* I'm not on Facebook any more and I delete and reinstate my Twitter
  account so often that I'm surprised it's not marked as spam, but if
  it's up, it's [@pseut](https://www.twitter.com/pseut). If you need
  to contact me, please call or email me. My personal email address,
  <gray@clhn.co>, also works for IM (Jabber).

Information about my [teaching](/index.html#Teaching),
[research](/index.html#Research), and [software
projects](/index.html#Software) is available on the [front
page](/index.html), as is my [contact
information](/index.html#Information).

## About this website:

I use [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap)
(obviously) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) (maybe less obviously),
to produce this website.  It is hosted at
[NearlyFreeSpeech.net](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/).

Twitter Bootstrap is licensed under the [Apache License
v2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) and Jekyll under the
[MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), so both are freely
available for your own work.
