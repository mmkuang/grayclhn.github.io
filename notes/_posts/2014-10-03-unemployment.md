These figures plot the US unemployment rate over time; each plot
emphasizes a single recession and recovery (the black line), but
includes the rest of the recoveries (in light blue) for
reference. They’re aligned horizontally so that period “0” is the
month the recession ended. The periods overlap.

The recessions themselves are highlighted in light red and their
beginning and end are marked with a small circle. The time periods are
chosen to contain the expansions before and after each recession. The
pictures are organized in chronological order.

I plan to update these graphs as data are released in the
future. These graphs were generated on October 3rd, 2014, just after
the September data were released by the BLS.

You can enlarge the graphs by clicking on them. That will also bring
up a nice slide-show-type viewer.

A few things to notice: unemployment rose a lot during the last
recession; it has been falling at about the same rate as in previous
recessions, but is still very high because its peak was so much
higher. Before the last few recessions, there was a substantial
recovery period where unemployment fell rapidly before slowing down,
but that hasn’t happened since the 1981 recession.
