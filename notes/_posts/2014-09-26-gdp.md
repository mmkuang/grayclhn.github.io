This figure shows real output in the US over the post-war business
cycles (WWII for those unfamiliar with the jargon) through the third
quarter of 2014. Each period was chosen to contain the expansions
immediately before and after each recession, and the segments were
aligned horizontally so that you can compare patterns.

I plan to update this page when new data are released. You can enlarge
the graph by clicking on it.

The black line plots US real GDP and and the gray line plots GDI
(Gross Domestic Income) over time for the indicated horizon: i.e. the
bottom lines show 1947q1 through 1953q2. Each period contains one
recession, and they’re aligned horizontally so that period “0” is the
quarter the recession ended. The periods overlap, so the second from
the bottom line shares observations on 1950 q 1 to 1953q2 with the
line below it. Basic economic accounting implies that the two series,
GDP and GDI, should be nearly equal, as every dollar spent in the
economy is a dollar that someone else earns in income. The two series
can be different in reality because they are estimated using different
surveys and data sets.

The picture uses a log scale along the vertical axis. This means that
periods of constant growth rate look like straight lines (i.e. a
growth rate of 3% per year looks like a straight line with a slope of
0.03). Bear in mind that the scale was chosen so that most lines would
be about 45 degrees, so it’s easy to see differences in slope but
probably difficult to read off the slope of any segment itself.

A few things jump out. There hasn’t been a “V-shaped” recession in the
US in about 30 years. The dominant pattern lately has been for growth
to resume at about the rate it was before the recession. Compare that
to any of the earlier recessions, where there’s a period of faster
growth once the recession ends.

Also, and even more important over the long run (but less viscerally
noticeable at the moment), GDP growth has fallen over the last
decade.You can see that, even ignoring the so-called “Great
Recession,” the slope of GDP over in the top period is flatter than
the previous one. This accumulates, so we’ll be much worse off in 10
years and 20 years than we would be otherwise unless that trend
changes.

The data are available through the St. Louis Fed ([GDP][1], GDI[2])
and the [R code used for the plots is on GitHub][3].
