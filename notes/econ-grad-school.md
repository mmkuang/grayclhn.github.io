title: Quick thoughts and advice on whether to get a PhD in economics

A friend emailed me to ask about grad school; I thought I might as
well share my thoughts here too. First, I should make it clear that I
basically never recommend getting a PhD to anyone. Grad school pays
almost nothing, is very stressful, damages most people’s
relationships, exacerbates any latent depression or anxiety issues you
might have, and the only payoff is that you’ll get to learn about one
or two things in intense, intense detail for years. So I emphasize the
negatives, reasoning that if you can hear all the downsides and still
think, “screw it, sounds like fun”... then going to grad school
*might* be a good idea. But if I can scare you away, then you never
should have tried to get a PhD in the first place.

That said, here are some more thoughts, in no particular order.

* If you’re going to get a PhD in the social sciences, or anything
  close to the social sciences, it should be in economics. You can do
  pretty much any of the other disciplines, but you’ll get paid
  considerably more and there are more academic positions, private
  sector and government jobs, etc available. Doing economics in a
  business school may be even better.

* I’d only suggest getting a PhD if you want a job teaching and/or
  doing research as a professor or at a research institute or
  think-tank. I don’t think that there are that many other jobs where
  the training is going to help. I’m sure there are jobs where having
  a PhD would be a nice addition for a candidate, but probably not so
  much that it’s worth 5–6 years of full time school. Of course, you
  might know of particular positions that I don’t.

* If you actually, you know, have a job, career, life, etc., that
  you’d be putting on hold for grad school (which is the case for the
  friend I mentioned above, but wasn’t for me when I applied) you
  should probably be pretty selective about where you’d go; so top 10
  or so only. Basically, you want a setup where, even if grad school
  goes badly and the job market is terrible when you graduate, you can
  have a job “better” than what you have now on graduation. That’s
  probably true if you go to Harvard, MIT, Stanford, etc., but not
  necessarily if you go to, say, UCSD. Obviously, you want to know who
  you plan to work with, but people change their minds once they get
  to grad school all the time, so being at a great school will give
  you options if you change your mind.

* If you’re coming straight out of college, or if you have a bad job
  with poor career prospects (I was working as a file clerk in the
  post dot-com bubble Bay Area two years after I graduated from
  college), you can take a bigger risk and go to a top 30 school that
  matches your presumed research interests. UCSD turned out to be a
  great fit for me, mostly because I was right when I expected to do
  econometrics.

* The first year of grad school (in Econ) will be really tough and
  unpleasant if you’ve been out of school for a little while. There’s
  a lot of math and it may have been a little while since you sat down
  and worked through proofs, etc. Expect that the core sequence of
  classes will be tough.
