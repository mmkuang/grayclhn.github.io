* Discuss syllabus and course resources on BlackBoard Learn

* Students should read chapters 6 and 18 on their own; they give a
  good general overview of the issues we'll discuss this semester.

* Look at key series:

  * Real GDP (Gross Domestic Product)  
    <http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=ewy>

  * Unemployment rate  
    <http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=ewz>

  * CPI (Consumer Price Index)  
    <http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=ewA>

  * CPI Inflation  
    (same source as CPI)

* These are the economy-wide equivalents of prices and quantities

* The subsequent graphs are provided by the Federal Reserve Bank of
  St. Louis who (I presume) owns the copyright.
