This is the course webpage for Economics 102 at Iowa State (Spring
2014). I am teaching two sections of 102 this spring, the [syllabus
for section 3 (meets 1–2 MWF) is here](syllabus-2014-s3) and the
[syllabus for section 4 (meets 2–3 MWF) is here](syllabus-2014-s4).
Before emailing the instructor or the TAs, please read [these email
guidelines](/dl/email).  ([Written by Michael Leddy][leddy].)  The
class is administered through
[Blackboard](https://bb.its.iastate.edu/) and all of our exams are
administered at the [ELO Testing
Center](http://www.elo.iastate.edu/online-testing-center/).

### Future coursework

If you like this class (or even if you don’t!) you might want to
consider majoring or minoring in economics. [A minor in
economics](http://www.econ.iastate.edu/undergraduate-programs/economics/economics-minor)
requires econ 301 (intermediate micro) and 6 more credits in addition
to econ 101 and 102, so you’re almost halfway done already. Other
options are majoring in [economics (LAS
college)](www.econ.iastate.edu/undergraduate-programs/economics),
[agricultural business
(ALS)](http://www.econ.iastate.edu/undergraduate-programs/agricultural-business)
or [business
economics](http://www.econ.iastate.edu/undergraduate-programs/business-economics)
(business college). [The department website has more information
about all of our undergraduate programs](http://www.econ.iastate.edu/undergraduate-programs).

Recommended resources
---------------------

* I’ve typically assigned Krugman and Wells’s *Macroeconomics* as the
  main reading for the class. There’s also a study guide avaiable for
  the book that is pretty good.
* Martha Olney’s *Macroeconomics as a second language* is a great
  resource as well.

### Less mathematically rigorous books

* Ben Bernanke, Fed Chair until Jan 2013, gave [four lectures on “The
  Federal Reserve and the Financial Crisis” that are available
  online](http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/lectures/about.htm). The
  lectures are free, but they’re also available [as a
  book](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9928.html). If you’re a fast
  reader, the book might be cost effective.
* [The Little Book of Economics, 2nd edition](http://gregip.wordpress.com/),
  by Greg Ip; a general overview of macro.
* [The Undercover Economist Strikes Back: How to Run — or Ruin — an Economy](http://timharford.com/books/undercovereconomist-strikes-back/).
  A “fun” (but reasonably accurate) introduction/overview of
  macroeconomics. No equations as far as I know.
* [Diary of a Very Bad Year: Confessions of an Anonymous Hedge Fund
  Manager](http://shop.nplusonemag.com/products/diary-of-a-very-bad-year-confessions-of-an-anonymous-hedge-fund-manager),
  by Keith Gessen; a series of interviews that the editor of a
  literary journal (n+1) did with a hedge fund manager during the
  recent financial crisis.

### Interesting papers

  ([dl](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10502475625744058059&hl)
  This paper is more difficult to read than the others, but it is
  absurdly famous and influential. Give it a try!

Material from previous semesters
--------------------------------

Since many students will have access to old exams, etc., from previous
times that I’ve taught this class, it seems only fair that I make some
of that material available to everyone. You probably should not treat
old exams as “practice tests,” because I change aspects of the
material and the order of the material every year. Most of the exams
have an answer key for the multiple choice questions on the last page.

* Spring, 2013:
  [syllabus](syllabus-2013),
  [midterm 1](test1-2013.pdf),
  [midterm 2](test2-2013.pdf), and
  [final](test-final-2013.pdf).
* Spring, 2012:
  [syllabus](syllabus-2012.pdf) and
  [midterm 1](test1-2012.pdf) only.
* Spring, 2011:
  [syllabus](syllabus-2011.pdf),
  [midterm 1](test1-2011.pdf),
  [midterm 2](test2-2011.pdf),
  [midterm 3](test3-2011.pdf), and
  [final](test-final-2011.pdf).
* Spring, 2010:
  [syllabus](syllabus-2010.pdf),
  [midterm 1](test1-2010.pdf),
  [midterm 2](test2-2010.odt), and
  [final](test-final-2010.odt).
  The midterms are missing answer keys.
