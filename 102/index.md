This is the course webpage for Economics 102 at Iowa State (Spring
2014). It has a few links, and that's about it.

* The class will be administered through
  [Blackboard](https://bb.its.iastate.edu/)
* All of our exams will be administered at the [ELO Testing
  Center](http://www.elo.iastate.edu/online-testing-center/)
* Before emailing the instructor or the TAs, please read [these
  email guidelines](/dl/email).

* [Syllabus for section 4 (meets 2–3 MWF)](syllabus-2014-s4)

Recommended resources
---------------------

* I've typically assigned Krugman and Wells's *Macroeconomics* as the
  main reading for the class.
* Martha Olney's *Macroeconomics as a second language* is a great
  resource as well.

### Less mathematically technical overviews

* Ben Bernanke, Fed Chair until Jan 2013, gave [four lectures on "The
  Federal Reserve and the Financial Crisis" that are available
  online](http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/lectures/about.htm). The
  lectures are free, but they're also available [as a
  book](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9928.html). If you're a fast
  reader, the book might be cost effective.
* [The Little Book of Economics, 2nd edition](http://gregip.wordpress.com/),
  by Greg Ip; a general overview of macro.
* [Diary of a Very Bad Year: Confessions of an Anonymous Hedge Fund
  Manager](http://shop.nplusonemag.com/products/diary-of-a-very-bad-year-confessions-of-an-anonymous-hedge-fund-manager),
  by Keith Gessen; a series of interviews that the editor of a
  literary journal (n+1) did with a hedge fund manager during the
  recent financial crisis.

### News and blogs

* [The Financial Times](http://www.ft.com), a daily newspaper.
* [The Economist](http://www.economist.com), a weekly news magazine.
* [FT Alphaville](http://ftalphaville.ft.com/) (free but requires registration)
* [Economist’s View](http://economistsview.typepad.com) (aggregator
  with some analysis)
* [Counterparties](http://counterparties.com/) (another aggregator)
* [Free Exchange](http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange) (the Economist's blog)
* [The Upshot](http://www.nytimes.com/upshot) (the NY Times' economics and politics blog)

Material from previous semesters
--------------------------------

Since many students will have access to old exams, etc., from previous
times that I've taught this class, it seems only fair that I make some
of that material available to everyone. You probably should not treat
old exams as "practice tests," because I change aspects of the
material and the order of the material every year. Most of the exams
have an answer key for the multiple choice questions on the last page.

* [Midterm 1 for Spring, 2010](test1-2010.pdf) (missing an answer key)
* [Midterm 2 for Spring, 2010](test2-2010.odt) (ODT format, missing an answer key)
* [Final exam for Spring, 2010](test-final-2010.odt) (ODT format)
* [Midterm 1 for Spring, 2011](test1-2011.pdf)
* [Midterm 2 for Spring, 2011](test2-2011.pdf)
* [Midterm 3 for Spring, 2011](test3-2011.pdf)
* [Final exam for Spring, 2011](test-final-2011.pdf)
* [Midterm 1 for Spring, 2012](test1-2012.pdf) (this is the only test
  available for 2012)
* [Midterm 1 for Spring, 2013](test1-2013.pdf)
* [Midterm 2 for Spring, 2013](test2-2013.pdf)
* [Final exam for Spring, 2013](test-final-2013.pdf)

I administered computer-based exams through the university test center
when I taught in 2014, so copies of those tests aren't avaialble.
