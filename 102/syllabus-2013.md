title: Econ 102 Syllabus (Principles of Macroeconomics, Gray Calhoun)
---

This class has two main goals. It will train you to better understand
global and national Macroeconomic events (recessions, expansions,
etc.), including the recent financial crisis and the current economic
slump.  And it will also give you the necessary background for future
classes in Economics and Business.

The course is divided into three parts:

1. The U.S. Macroeconomy overall: what the important series are and
   how recessions and expansions propegate.

2. How macroeconomic policy is conducted, given what we discussed in
   the first part of the course.

3. Issues relevant to international (open-economy) Macroeconomics:
   long-run economic growth; capital flows and trade between countries;
   and exchange rates.

The first two parts will be followed by midterm exams and the last
part will be followed by the final.

The class meets Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 2:10 to 3:00 in
Coover 2245 and my office hours are Monday and Wednesday from 3:00 to
4:00 in Heady 467.  The TAs' office hours haven't been set
yet but will be announced on Blackboard Learn when they are available.
If you have questions about the course material, the best times to
address them are in the scheduled lectures or during office hours. We
can probably resolve questions or concerns about the course
administration over email, but if you have urgent questions please
stop by my office.  The next table lists basic contact information for
the instructor (me) and TAs:

### Instructor: Gray Calhoun

I will use [BlackBoard Learn](https://bb.its.iastate.edu) to
distribute grades, announcements, and handouts before each class.  This
syllabus will also be available on my website at
<http://gray.clhn.co/handouts/2013/econ-102-syllabus.html>.

Grades
------

Your course grade will be based on three exam grades; homework is
optional, but doing practice exercises is the best way to understand
and learn the material and do well on the exams.  I will also give
opportunities in class for students to earn extra credit.

* Midterm 1: 30% of grade
  - February 22
  - covers ch. 6-8 and 10-12

* Midterm 2: 30% of grade
  - April 12th
  - covers ch. 13-17

* Final exam: 40% of grade
  - May 7th, 12-2pm
  - covers ch. 6-17, 19

The "chapters covered" refers to the required textbook,
*Macroeconomics* by Paul Krugman and Robin Wells.  I do not give make
up exams, but we can make arrangements if you have a legitimate reason
for missing a test.

Textbooks
---------

### Required
There is one required text that the lectures will follow closely:

* [Macroeconomics, Third
  edition](http://bcs.worthpublishers.com/krugmanwellsmacro3), by Paul
  Krugman and Robin Wells.  The third edition has some new material on
  the recent financial crisis.

### Recommended
The next books are not required but are useful.  Both use less math
and provide different perspectives than the textbook.

* [The Little Book of Economics](http://gregip.wordpress.com/), by
  Greg Ip. This book describes Macroeconomics with very few equations,
  charts, or graphs.  It also talks about the recent financial
  crisis. This book can help if you want to understand how the topics
  covered by the textbook and lectures apply to current events.

* [Diary of a Very Bad Year: Confessions of an Anonymous Hedge Fund
    Manager](http://shop.nplusonemag.com/products/diary-of-a-very-bad-year-confessions-of-an-anonymous-hedge-fund-manager),
    by Keith Gessen.  This book comes from a series of interviews that
    the editor of a literary journal (n+1) did with a hedge fund
    manager during the recent financial crisis.

### News and current events
Macroeconomics has dominated the news lately.  You are not required to
follow current events in this class, but you may find doing so
interesting and useful.  The following sources have particularly
strong coverage of Economics:

* [The Financial Times](http://www.ft.com), a daily newspaper.

* [The Economist](http://www.economist.com), a weekly news magazine.


University policies
-------------------

The following policies apply to *every* course at Iowa State
University. They are listed here for your convenience and reference.

### Academic dishonesty

The class will follow Iowa State University's policy on academic
dishonesty.  Anyone suspected of academic dishonesty will be reported
to the Dean of Students Office,
<http://www.dso.iastate.edu/ja/academic/misconduct.html>.

### Disability accommodation

This material can be provided to you in alternative format. Anyone who
anticipates difficulties with the content or format of the course due
to a physical or learning disability should see me immediately in
order to work out a plan. You may also want to contact the Disability
Resources (DR) office, located on the main floor of the Student
Services Building, Room 1076 or call them at 515-294-7220.

### Dead week

For academic programs, the last week of classes is considered to be a
normal week in the semester except that in developing their syllabi
faculty shall consider the following guidelines:

* Mandatory final examinations in any course may not be given during
  Dead Week except for laboratory courses and for those classes
  meeting once a week only and for which there is no contact during
  the normal final exam week. Take home final exams and small quizzes
  are generally acceptable. (For example, quizzes worth no more than
  10 percent of the final grade and/or that cover no more than
  one-fourth of assigned reading material in the course could be
  given).

* Major course assignments should be assigned prior to Dead Week
  (major assignments include major research papers, projects,
  etc.). Any modifications to assignments should be made in a timely
  fashion to give students adequate time to complete the assignments.

* Major course assignments should be due no later than the Friday
  prior to Dead Week. Exceptions include class presentations by
  students, semester-long projects such as a design project in lieu of
  a final, and extensions of the deadline requested by students.

### Harassment and discrimination

Iowa State University strives to maintain our campus as a place of
work and study for faculty, staff, and students that is free of all
forms of prohibited discrimination and harassment based upon race,
ethnicity, sex (including sexual assault), pregnancy, color, religion,
national origin, physical or mental disability, age, marital status,
sexual orientation, gender identity, genetic information, or status as
a U.S. veteran. Any student who has concerns about such behavior
should contact his/her instructor, Student Assistance at 515-294-1020,
or the Office of Equal Opportunity and Compliance at 515-294-7612.

### Religious accommodation

If an academic or work requirement conflicts with your religious
practices and/or observances, you may request reasonable
accommodations. Your request must be in writing, and your instructor
or supervisor will review the request.  You or your instructor may
also seek assistance from the Dean of Students Office or the Office of
Equal Opportunity and Compliance.

### Contact information

If you feel that any of your rights as a student have been violated,
please email <academicissues@iastate.edu>.
